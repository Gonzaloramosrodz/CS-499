# CS 499 Final Project – Animal Shelter Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains my final capstone project for the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. The project demonstrates competencies in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. The core artifact is an interactive dashboard for Grazioso Salvare, a non-profit animal rescue organization. The dashboard was originally developed in CS 340 and has been enhanced in this project to demonstrate professional software development practices.

## Features
- Interactive data table with advanced filtering
- Geolocation mapping of shelter animals
- Pie charts and visualizations for classification
- Algorithmic enhancements to demonstrate sorting and search efficiency
- Modularized code structure for maintainability

## Enhancements
1. **Software Engineering** – Refactored and organized the code into reusable modules, improved commenting, and added error handling.
2. **Algorithms and Data Structures** – Implemented sorting and searching functions for efficient filtering of animal records.
3. **Databases** – Extended MongoDB integration with advanced queries and aggregation pipelines.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- MongoDB running locally or remotely
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
